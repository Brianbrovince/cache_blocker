force browser to reload file without caching

When doing making updates on the web, you may realize that most browsers cache images,css, js ... basically files. It gets tricky
when you push js and css updates and you the changes don't effect, you may have a way of forcing the browser to refresh (which is CTRL + F5 if you don't),
what about your client?

I have an simple way of handling this in PHP.
-------check the php file
